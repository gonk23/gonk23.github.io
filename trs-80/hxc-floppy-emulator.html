        <h1>TRS-80 - HxC floppy emulator</h1>
        <p>
            I purchased the HxC (<a href="http://hxc2001.com" target="_blank">http://hxc2001.com</a>)
            SD floppy emulator rev C (cased) and connected it to the TRS-80 Model III external floppy port (as drives :2 and :3).
        </p>

            The TRS-80 drives are normally numbered as follows:<br />
            :0 = first internal drive<br />
            :1 = second internal drive<br />
            :2 = first external drive<br />
            :3 = second external drive
        </p>
        <p>
            (It can also be connected to the internal floppy port (as drives :0 and :1) which would allow booting from the emulator,
            however this would obviously require removing the cover of the TRS-80.)
        </p>
        <p>
            A normal straight-through (untwisted) ribbon cable was used between the TRS-80 and HxC. Make sure the cable is plugged the right way into the TRS-80 and HxC.

            Use the standard Shugart jumper settings on the HxC, i.e. a jumper on ID0 for "Drive A" and a jumper on ID1 for "Drive B".
            Do not use ID2 or ID3 regardless of whether you're connecting it to the internal or external floppy port.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: HxC firmware V1.8.2.20a or later is required to change drive B disks on the TRS-80.

            I created a simple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg53G9RjvMM" target="_blank">YouTube video</a> to demonstrate its use.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the video I booted the TRS-80 using a normal physical floppy disk in internal drive :0.
            I then used the LDOS SYSTEM command to swap physical drive :0 with emulated drive :2, which contained a disk image also with the LDOS system installed.
            This allowed me to remove the physical floppy from drive :0. The LDOS command is:<br />
            SYSTEM (SWAP=0, DRIVE=2)
        </p>
        <p>
            The DEVICES command can then be used to show the two emulated drives mounted as :0 and :3.
            The emulator supports DSDD80 (720kB) disk images, which is great for storing lots of programs.
            The standard physical TRS-80 Model III floppy disk is only SSDD40 (180kB).
