            These active speakers had developed a fault where the right speaker was not working.<br />
            Apparently this is a common fault most likely due to a problematic headphone jack which affects the BT3, BT4, and BT5 models.<br />
            Sometimes inserting a plug in/out of the jack or cleaning it fixes the problem, however I found that after a while, even this didn't help.<br />
            <br />
            This page describes a method to bypass the headphone jack so both speakers work again, however the headphone jack will no longer work.<br />
            A proper fix would replace the headphone jack, however unfortunately it is glued into the case so I didn't think it was worth demolishing the case to do this.<br />

            First remove the outer screws from the back of the right speaker and wiggle out the main board.

            Take note (e.g. by taking a photo) of how the cables are plugged into the main board, and then unplug the cables to free the main board from the case.

            On the main board, locate connector CN3-A which the headphone jack cables were plugged into. To implement this fix, you'll want to short the 2 upper pins to each other and the 2 lower pins to each other, leaving the middle pin.

            Here's a close-up of CN3-A.

            In order to short the pins, I used old motherboard jumper caps as shown. These jumper caps just connect 2 pins together; they're often black but mine are red.

            Now plug in all the cables (except for the headphone jack cables connector) and screw the unit back together again.
